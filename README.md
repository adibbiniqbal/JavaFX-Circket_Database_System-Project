## üß© About Part 1

This project is a **continuation** of a terminal-based cricket management system developed earlier.  
**Part 1** was implemented using **core Java** and focused on basic functionality via the command-line interface.

- No database was used  
- All data (players, teams, stats) were stored using **file read/write**
- Interaction was done through a **text-based menu**
- File: `players.txt` was used for persistent storage

You can find the Part 1 project here:
